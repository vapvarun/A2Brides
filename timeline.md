- Faster troubleshooting of plugin interactions and customizations
- More efficient custom code development with fewer iterations
- Better understanding of WordPress hooks and filters for customizations
- Ability to optimize database queries and performance from the start
- Experience with WooCommerce product structures and extensions
- Familiarity with testing procedures and optimization techniques

With your advanced development skills, you may also be able to implement custom solutions instead of relying on some plugins, potentially improving performance and reducing dependencies. You might also be able to parallelize certain aspects of the development, which could further compress the timeline.
